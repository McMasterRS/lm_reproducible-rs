# FAIR Software

FAIR software is research software which meets the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability for external and internal parties. The FAIR principles were developed to promote openness, accessibility, and usability of research data and software. When applied to research software, the FAIR principles aim to maximize its impact, transparency, and reproducibility.

Here's what each aspect of FAIR entails when applied to research software:  

1. Findability

    Findability focuses on making research software discoverable both by humans and machines. This involves providing metadata and appropriate identifiers for the software, such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) or Persistent Identifiers (PIDs). Findable software should have clear and persistent references, making it easier for others to locate and access using common search engines. While DOIs themselves do not directly affect search engine optimization (SEO), they facilitate the proper identification, linking, and accessibility of research content. These factors, in turn, can contribute to improved visibility, higher authority, and increased citation rates, which can indirectly impact the SEO of research outputs.  

2. Accessibility

    Accessibility ensures that research software is available and accessible to a wide range of users. This involves providing open access to the software, which may include making it publicly available through repositories, code-sharing platforms, or project websites. Accessibility also encompasses clear licensing and usage terms to define how the software can be used and reused.  

3. Interoperability

    Interoperability refers to the ability of research software to work seamlessly with other tools, systems, and data. Interoperable software is designed with standardized interfaces, data formats, and protocols, enabling integration and interoperability with other software components. Adhering to open standards and using well-documented and widely accepted formats promotes interoperability.  

4. Reusability

    Reusability emphasizes designing research software in a way that facilitates its reuse by other researchers and developers. Reusable software should be well-documented, including clear instructions, code comments, and user guides. It should be modular, well-structured, and accompanied by appropriate documentation, examples, and test cases to make it easier for others to understand, modify, and build upon the software.  

By following the FAIR principles, research software becomes more transparent, collaborative, and impactful. It enables others to find, access, understand, and reuse the software effectively, contributing to the reproducibility and sustainability of research outcomes. It also fosters a culture of openness and sharing, allowing for validation, collaboration, and continuing advancements in research fields.
