## Reproducible Research Software

Reproducibility helps to build the foundation for a meaningful discussion about whether there might be issues in the analysis of a research and how such issues might be resolved. A published data analysis is said to be reproducible if the analytic datasets and computer code used to create the analysis are shared to others for independent study and analysis.  

The increasing complexity of statistical and computational techniques in data processing pipelines has mitigated the reproducibility of analytic research. Hence, we must first identify the goals of reproducible research, that is allowing other researchers to retrace every (computer code) step and underlying logic in the process and as a result. understand how the original author drew such conclusion or identify potential issues with the analysis. We can develop some general practices and technical frameworks to mitigate the uncertainty in computation and achieve more reproducible research.  

The learning module intends to provide guidance on how to improve reproducibility in your research software based on the FAIR principles.
