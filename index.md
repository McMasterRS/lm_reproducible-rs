## Reproducible Research Software

Reproducible research software is a key component of the broader movement towards making scientific research more transparent, reliable, and accessible. It emphasizes the importance of providing comprehensive and detailed documentation, code, and data that enable others to reproduce and validate research findings. In the context of software development, reproducible research software refers to the creation of software systems and tools that facilitate the reproducibility of scientific experiments, analyses, and simulations.  

Reproducible research software fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing within the scientific community. By openly sharing software and associated artifacts, researchers enable others to replicate experiments, validate results, and build upon existing work. This promotes the verification and refinement of scientific findings, helps avoid duplication of effort, and accelerates the advancement of knowledge.  

The learning module intends to provide guidance on how to improve reproducibility in your research software based on the FAIR principles.  

### Learning Outcome

By the end of this learning module, readers will be able to:  

- Have a high-level understanding of FAIR principles in a research software context
- Consider a sustainable research software planning with the help of a software management plan
- Develop and manage software to comply with FAIR4RS principles
