McMaster University and McMaster Research Software Development Team are not responsible for the content referenced in this guide.

It is encourage to assign an appropriate licence for your research software project. When choosing a license, consider the following:  

- How the software can be used?
- Are modifications/distributions of the software possible with/without reference to your name, organization and the license you have chosen?
- Is the software available for commercial use?
- Do you or your organization own/use any patents in the research software project?
- Do the tools/libraries you used to develop the software require you to reference or enforce the license you need to use?

Where possible, use existing licenses, such as GNU General Public License and MIT License, rather than creating a custom terms of use. And are some resources for comparing different licenses.
