## Preservation & Sustainability

Research software preservation has 4 major aspects.  

1. Storage

    Software packages or code need to be stored and indexed with reliable version control management services.  

2. Retrieval

    A preserved software package as well as its dependencies need to be clearly labeled and identified with a suitable catalog. In some cases, the dependencies need to be bundled with the software package. It is to prevent the preserved software from being unusable if the dependencies cannot be retrieved in the future. See the [`left-pad` debacle](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code).  

3. Construction

    Adequate descriptive documentation needs to be provided to make sure the software package can be rebuilt using the preserved software source code and reinstalled within a sufficiently close environment to the original so it will execute properly.  

4. Replay

    Include test cases that demonstrate the preserved software is producing the correct results.
