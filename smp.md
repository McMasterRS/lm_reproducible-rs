## Software Management Plan (SMP)

It is a formal document that defines what you will develop, who the software is for, how it will be delivered and how it will be supported over time. The plan addresses management during the active phases of development and sustainability once the project is completed.  

An SMP typically includes the following contents:  

- Assets Used & Produced
- Software Documentation & Version Control Protocol
- Preservation & Sustainability
- Roles & Responsibilities
- Software Dissemination & Sharing
- Ethics, Licensing & Legal Compliance

Utilizing a software management plan is highly recommended to ensure the desired level of reproducibility in your project. Achieving absolute reproducibility is challenging given the growing complexity of statistical and computational techniques, such as multi-threading and pseudo-randomness. However, by clearly defining reproducibility goals and implementing a comprehensive SMP, you can employ targeted best practices to reduce computational uncertainty and enhance research reproducibility.  

Here is an article about different levels of reproducibility in research software, [_How reproducible should research software be?_](https://zenodo.org/record/4761867).
